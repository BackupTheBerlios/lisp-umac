<h2>Unlisp</h2>

Unlisp has:

<ul>
  <li>A reader macro and macro for writing functions with binary function notation. [a+b*2] and such. 
    Supports order of operation.</li>
  <li>fancy-scope macro that adds = (setting), := (defining), working via <a href="scope.html">scope</a>.
  <li>A reader macro that makes things between curly brackets {} point to a macro. Activate with
(unlisp:fancy :curly-hooks to-macro) if (eql to-macro t) it points to fancy-scope</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the features of unlisp are evil!</p>

<p>One thing i might add is Polish notation with hooks when you need to 
decide precidence, 
notation similar to Haskell and OCaml. Of course &key(?), &optional and 
&rest arguments are going to need hooks.</p>
