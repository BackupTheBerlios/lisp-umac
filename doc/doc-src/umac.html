<h2>Umac</h2>
This is a little thing i made in order to loop, accumulate and reduce easily. One guideline 
for it's development is that it never scans regular code, instead relying on a form to put 
things in that do the 'special' stuff.
It would seem likely that <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/iterate/">iterate</a> is 
superior to it.(Although i am no expert on iterate) It does, however have advantages over LOOP:

<ul><li>It can work inside functions, so it can be used in callbacks.</li>
    <li>On the inside, it is simpler, only 178 lines.(Including basic extensions.)
 (Also advantage vs iterate.)</li>
    <li>It's body is just a regular body, it doesn't have to reinvent IF, WHEN, COND, 
etcetera.</li>
    <li>It is extensible.</li>
</ul>

It also has disadvantages:
<ul><li>Special stuff has to be in the form.</li>
    <li>Since it doesn't look into body/macroexpansion it can't see what in it's flet, let,
      etcetera is actually necessary. A lot of useless fluff in the macroexpansion result.
    (It isn't pretty, but it shouldn't affect performance.</li>
    <li>No <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/iterate/doc/Named-Blocks.html#Named-Blocks">
	named blocks</a> that iterate has.(yet)</li>
</ul>

I made a <a href="http://www.lispforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=295">discussion thread</a> about it.

<h3>Getting it</h3>
You can get it <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/git/?group_id=10729">via git</a>, or via 
<a href="http://download.berlios.de/gitdumps/lisp-umac-git.tar.gz">daily git tarballs</a>.
There is no documentation. Read the code and documentation strings. Also, it rather untested, but
i think it will probably all work.

<h3>Development</h3>
I don't expect to develop umac any further. You can ask me for access/ ask me to add changes to 
source/added extensions, if you are so inclined. (Always try to do things with extensions first.)

<h3>Auto-documentation</h3>
