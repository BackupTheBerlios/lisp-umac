This page was originally for the <a href="umac.html">umac</a> macro, but
 now i have a superior macro, <a href="main.html#denest">denest</a>. 
There are also added some other (reader)macros, like <a href="scope.html">
scope</a> and <a href="unlisp.html">unlisp</a>.

<a name="denest"><h2>Denest</h2></a>

<p>Denest is a macro to de-nest code. Although the real thing also has some
 stuff to help with accumulating and to make good use of keywords, its basic
form is:</p>

<code>(defmacro denest (&rest args)
  (if (null (cdr args))
    (car args)
    `(,@(car args)
        (denest ,@(cdr args)))))</code>

<p>That simple, and if used properly, it is easy to execute back and forth
in your mind. Given the right macros to input, it also seems to address
 the problem that other macros, like iterate, loop, bind try to solve in a
 more complicated fashion.</p>

<p><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/metabang-bind/documentation/metabang.bind-package/index.html">
    Metabang-bind</a>, and <a href="http://github.com/ks/X.LET-STAR">let-star</a> 
  could somewhat do this too, but the makers didn't realize that this is (imo) what
  it comes down to; you are limited in what form it is entered, have to explicitly
ask for it. (And let-star doesn't expose its <a href="http://github.com/ks/X.LET-STAR/blob/master/let-star.lisp#L37">
<code>define-binder</code></a>, i forgot whether metabang-bind did.
</p>

<p>I also mentioned it <a href="http://lispforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=295&sid=bd1bc74cbdd9eeea5d904d1a0cbb0d4b&start=30#p3068">
in this forum</a>.</p>

<a name="Useage"><h3>Usage</h3></a>

You can load it using either simply <code>(load "denest.lisp")</code>
(Well the path to there too), or <code>(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :denest)</code>
 There are examples in use-rest/play-denest.lisp, and
 <a href="autodoc/denest.html">there is documentation</a>.
